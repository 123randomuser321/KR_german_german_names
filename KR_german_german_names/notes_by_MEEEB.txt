Hello reader!

This document gives a quick rundown on sources, files, and other things.


Sources:

My brain.
The KR wiki: https://kaiserreich.fandom.com/wiki/The_Kaiserreich_Wiki
Wikipedia: https://www.wikipedia.org/


General notes:

This mod replaces some of KR's country names, specifically those of German countries,
with their actual (and/or guessed) German names.
For example: German Empire --> Deutsches Reich


Files added:

/localisation/replace/KR_german_german_names_l_english.yml
/logo.png
/notes_by_MEEEB.txt (this document)


Dev notes:

I will probably need to modify this mod a bit.
For example, I need to find out which Swiss cosmetic tag turns Switzerland French,
and act accordingly.

But it's good enough for now.
